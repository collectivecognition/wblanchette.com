[Prose.io](http://www.prose.io) is a promising tool for managing text-based files in your Github repositories, with an emphasis on static / jekyll sites hosted on Github pages.

Based on a quick glance I can see it very quickly becoming a part of my workflow. While checking in a new blog post to one of my sites is a nearly painless process now, Prose looks to make it even easier, with a very nice UI to boot.

Unfortunately, until Github supports jekyll plugins, i'll still have to pull posts generated with Prose down to my local machine to build and push back out, but it still sands down a couple of pain points in the meantime.
